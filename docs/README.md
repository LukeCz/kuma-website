enhance your service connectivity for the entire application, databases included.

* Fast, lightweight, highly available
* 10+ bundled policies for L4/L7 traffic

### Kubernetes and Universal mode

With Kuma you can build service connectivity and Service Meshes across a large variety 
of platforms and clouds. Platform agnostic by nature, Kuma supports modern Kubernetes 
environments and Universal VM workloads in the same cluster, with no effort.

* Kubernetes, VMs and Bare Metal
* Multi K8s-Namespace and Multi-Cloud support
* For both North-South and East-West traffic

### One cluster for the entire organization

Multi-tenant since day one, with Kuma you can create as many independent Service Meshes
as you need with one control plane. This reduces the operational costs of supporting
the entire organization in a significant way.

* Multi-Tenancy for multiple Meshes
* Ops complexity is O(1), not O(n)
* One Runtime, scalable horizontally
